# Live Voting App Feature Documentation

Feature documentation for the live voting app will be maintained in `cursor/feature_docs/` as a living document, following our collaborative process.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Please refer to Document.md for the project details.
